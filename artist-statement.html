  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>





    <p id="statement" class="col-lg-12">
The game, Fishin' Around, displays a fish swimming through his habitat and collecting coins. As the fish continues to swim, they start to notice that their environment is gradually changing... Plastic waste such as water bottles, trash bags, bowls, forks, and straws continues to pollute the fish's environment. Plastic debris causes significant injuries and damage to these marine species as they either consume or are caught within it. I chose this idea for the game as the purpose or message is to depict and bring awareness to the marine plastic pollution issue in our own waters today. We need to better!
